This module distributes an OpenFlow packet_in handler 
to the switches in an OpenFlow network. It somehow detects and 
synchronizes all the global variables (i.e. those that are 
modified by multiple switches). Is that even possible? 

What implementation Options are there? 

Design 1:
forward all packets to the controller, through OFX. 
- baseline implementation, just to see what its like when 
using the OFX path

Design 2:
push the entire packet handler down to the switch.
- need to rewrite it to use the OFX packet in message.
- this will probably mangle a lot of applications. 
	- particularly global state

Design 3: 
push parts of the packet handler to the switch. 
- what parts? how to determine?

Design 4: 
push the entire packet handler down to the switch, 
but detect which variables are global and then 
synchronize them. 

Imagine.. Being able to just specify how you want to detect and react to malicious traffic on your network, without needing to worry about any of the implementation or deployment details. 
- cost modeling (ok, if we use this technique, we can handle this much traffic)
- distribution of centralized logic

This is kind of like... not imperitive? that other word <other word> network security programming.
